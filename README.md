# CrisisNLP-Classifying-and-Normalizing-Twitter-Messages-for-Disaster-Response
Overview
This notebook is based on the paper "Twitter as a Lifeline: Human-annotated Twitter Corpora for NLP of Crisis-related Messages" by Imran et al. The study presents a large-scale dataset of over 52 million crisis-related tweets collected during 19 major disasters from 2013â€“2015 out of which I've used 9 of those datasets. It includes human-annotated corpora for multiclass classification and text normalization tasks, making it highly valuable for natural language processing in emergency response scenarios.

In this notebook, we:

Explore the annotated datasets,

Train supervised models (Naive Bayes, LSTM) to classify crisis tweets,

Utilize GLOVE embeddings, and

Demonstrate techniques for normalizing informal or noisy Twitter text (OOV terms).

These tools aim to support timely and effective information extraction from social media during disasters to aid humanitarian efforts.
